# Test Case 50: Route Score Lookups

## Problem Summary

- CPU category and cause: Backend Bound — latency from scattered score-table
  reads. The route-scoring loop spends much of its time waiting for scores from
  a table with a large memory footprint.
- Scores must be combined in the supplied order so the fingerprint remains
  unchanged.

## ID

- `test_case_50`

## Public Intent (safe summary)

- Read scores for a shuffled route stream and combine them in the supplied
  order.
- Keep the stream unchanged while looking for a way to hide the cost of reading
  scores from the large table.

## What's Wrong In Current Implementation

- Scattered score-table reads frequently wait for data or an address mapping
  that is not already available to the CPU.
- The loop waits for each score before doing the inexpensive fingerprint
  update, even though later route identifiers are already known.

## What The LLM Should Suggest

- Give no more than two concrete changes, chosen from:
  - arrange scores for contiguous consumption in route order, without changing
    the fingerprint order; or
  - load scores for future route identifiers early, using a small look-ahead
    buffer or software prefetch while preserving result order.

## Scoring Guidance

- Pass:
  - Makes one concrete assessment that delays from the large, scattered
    score-table reads are the underlying problem.
  - Recommends one or both changes above and explains how they reduce or hide
    score-read latency.
  - Gives no more than two distinct remedies.
  - Treats an ordered score list, a pre-resolved score stream and an equivalent
    order-preserving layout as variants of one remedy.
  - Uses the available profile evidence to support the conclusion. No specific
    measurement or profiling recipe is required.
- Fail:
  - Identifies only the expensive source line but cannot choose the cause or a
    concrete next step.
  - Lists several possible causes or asks for another profile before choosing
    what to change.
  - Suggests sorting or grouping route identifiers in a way that changes their
    order or the fingerprint.
  - Gives only a generic instruction to improve locality.
  - Recommends more than two unrelated remedies.
